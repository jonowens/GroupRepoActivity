## A Disruptor in Consumer Trading and Lending

RobinHood is an internet stock trading platform that offers unlumited commission free trading for 
-   STOCKS IN U.S. public comp
Another Millennial-friendly difference between RobinHood and the others is that RobinHood accounts have no minimum deposit. In 2018, RobinHood developed its own clearing operation (See below for link explaining this.). Last December, RobinHood announced that they plan to offer no-fee, no-minimum checking accounts with a 3% interest paid on account balances, a far better deal than established banks.

What do they do?`

Who are the competitors?

How does this company use technology to their advantage?

The company is considered a FinTech company as it is an internet stock trading platform offering unlimited commission free trading for stocks in U.S. public companies, ETF’s (exchange traded funds), Stock options, and Cryptocurrencies allowing them to bein multiple domains.

As a result, RobinHood is growing extremely fast. As of about 8 months ago, they had about 250
employees, but the Bloomberg Businessweek article states that “RobinHood plans to add 150 backoffice and customer service employees to its Orlando operation, and hundreds more in Menlo Park.”

What are their strengths and weaknesses?

What is the prognosis for this company?

Where do they expect to be in the future?
