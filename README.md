## A Disruptor in Consumer Trading and Lending

RobinHood is an internet stock trading platform that offers unlumited commission free trading for 
-   STOCKS IN U.S. public comp
Another Millennial-friendly difference between RobinHood and the others is that RobinHood accounts have no minimum deposit. In 2018, RobinHood developed its own clearing operation (See below for link explaining this.). Last December, RobinHood announced that they plan to offer no-fee, no-minimum checking accounts with a 3% interest paid on account balances, a far better deal than established banks. [3]

What do they do?`

- 

Who are the competitors?

- RobinHood has many competitors from traditional brokerages to online platforms. The main ones are:
    - M1 Finance
    - Webull
    - Merrill Edge
    - TD Ameritrade
    - Interactive Brokers [4]

How does this company use technology to their advantage?

- 

Why are they considered a FinTech company?

- Robinhood is an internet stock trading platform offering unlimited commission free trading for stocks in U.S. public companies, ETF’s (exchange traded funds), Stock options, and Cryptocurrencies allowing them to bein multiple domains. [3]

Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space?

- As a result, RobinHood is growing extremely fast. As of about 8 months ago, they had about 250
employees, but the Bloomberg Businessweek article states that “RobinHood plans to add 150 backoffice and customer service employees to its Orlando operation, and hundreds more in Menlo Park.” [3]

What are their strengths and weaknesses?

- RobinHood offers a no-fee, no-minimum checking accounts with a 3% interest paid on account balances (better deal than established banks)
- RobinHood customers primarily access the RobinHood trading platform via an easy-to-use mobile app, This appeals to RobinHood’s target market, i.e. 
- Millennials, a demographic segment that has been under-served by established banks and brokerage firms. 
- RobinHood accounts have no minimum deposit.
- Cost savings and efficiencies through internet processing 
- Disrupts the commission-based business model 
- On-line stock trading is an enormous business [3]

What is the prognosis for this company?

- In the very near future, Robinhood will have worked out the kinks in its trading platform and will increase in status as more people migrate to the platform. The ease of use will be a big factor in pulling the uninitiated into the stock market. One of two things are likely to happen. One Robin grows big and transforms into a full fledged online investment company. In the meanwhile, Robinhood will face regulatory challenges and likely customer lawsuits related to how it places trades and how it receives compensation. [3]

Where do they expect to be in the future?
